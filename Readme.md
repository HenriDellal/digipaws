# DigiPaws: Reclaim Your Life

DigiPaws is an open-source Android productivity utility designed to help users reduce screen addiction by regulating app usage through a gamified experience. The application offers three distinct modes—Easy, Adventure, and Hard—each with unique features and challenges to promote healthy screen time habits.


## Features

- **Three Unique Modes**: Tailor your screen usage experience with Easy, Adventure, and Hard modes.
- **Gamified Challenges**: Earn DigiCoins through quests like walking, and use them to unlock app usage.
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and free to use, with the source code available for community contributions.
- **Productivity Enhancement**: Helps build healthier digital habits and reduce screen addiction.
- **Versatile Blockers**: Take control of your digital environment by blocking apps, keywords, and unwanted in-app screens (e.g., YouTube shorts, comments).


## Modes

### Easy Mode

In Easy Mode, DigiPaws provides gentle reminders to help you manage your screen time. When you attempt to access a blocked app, a warning screen appears. If you choose to proceed, a cooldown period starts. After the cooldown, another warning is displayed to remind you of your usage.

### Adventure Mode

Adventure Mode introduces a gamified experience to control screen time. To access a blocked app, you need DigiCoins. These can be earned by completing quests such as a quick 1 km walk. Each DigiCoin grants 20 minutes of usage time for any blocked app, encouraging physical activity and mindful screen use.

#### Quests
1. **Touch Grass** - Displace yourself by 1km
2. more quests comming soon. Drop ideas on my dm.

### Hard Mode

Hard Mode offers the most stringent control over app usage. In this mode, when you try to open a blocked app, the back button is automatically pressed without any warning or cooldown, preventing access entirely.

## Usage

1. Launch DigiPaws on your Android device.
2. Provide all necessary permissions like Accessibility service, Notification, Draw over other apps etc
3. Choose your preferred mode: Easy, Adventure, or Hard.
4. Configure the apps and views you want to block and set your preferences.
5. Start using your device with DigiPaws managing your screen time.
