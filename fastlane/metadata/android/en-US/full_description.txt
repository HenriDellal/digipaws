<b>Easy Mode</b>

In Easy Mode, DigiPaws provides gentle reminders to help you manage your screen time. When you attempt to access a blocked app, a warning screen appears. If you choose to proceed, a cooldown period starts. After the cooldown, another warning is displayed to remind you of your usage.

<b>Adventure Mode</b>

Adventure Mode introduces a gamified experience to control screen time. To access a blocked app, you need Aura. These can be earned by completing quests such as a quick 1 km walk. Each Aura coin grants 20 minutes of usage time for any blocked app, encouraging physical activity and mindful screen use. Learn more -> https://nethical6.github.io/digipaws/about/quests/

<b>Quests</b>
 * <b>Focus Quest</b> - Apply the 20/60 study rule: Digipaws blocks all unnecessary applications except basic apps like calling and SMS. Cannot be stopped once started :)
 * <b>Open API</b> - See the list of applications using our quest API: https://nethical6.github.io/digipaws/partners/
NOTE: This is the lite version, which has fewer inbuild quests compared to the full version. 

<b>Hard Mode</b>

Hard Mode offers the most stringent control over app usage. In this mode, when you try to open a blocked app, the back button is automatically pressed without any warning or cooldown, preventing access entirely.
